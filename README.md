## ü™Ñ About MetaWave

**MetaWave** is a self‚Äëmanaged music library & micro‚Äëpublishing interface for indie creators:

| Pain Before                            | MetaWave Solution                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Folders full of inconsistent MP3 names | Canonical metadata fields & controlled edit modals           |
| No cover / outdated cover art          | Inline single & batch cover uploads via Supabase Storage     |
| Manual track order headaches           | Drag & drop ordering saved positionally per album            |

## üóÉ Track Metadata & Artwork Pipeline

MetaWave's track management is designed to be intuitive and efficient, allowing users to easily manage their audio files and associated metadata. The process involves several key steps:

| Step               | Details                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File Upload        | Track initial file (MP3) uploaded elsewhere (upload page) ‚Üí gets `file_url`, `file_size`, optional `duration_secs` (or recomputed)            |
| Cover Art (single) | User picks image ‚Üí stored at `covers/{owner_id}/covers/{uuid}-{filename}` bucket                                                              |
| Batch Cover        | Loop selected tracks, push same image under unique path per track (or reuse identical URL)                                                    |
| Duration           | If missing, `<Audio>` preloads metadata ‚Üí updates local display (without extra server write)                                                  |
| Editing            | Dialog with controlled inputs + file watchers; `updateTrack` Zod gate ensures shape                                                           |
| Validation         | Title required, artist optional, date optional, boolean public flag, safe fallback defaults                                                   |
| Waveform           | Rendered with WaveSurfer.js, using `file_url` for audio source, dynamic colors based on theme toggle.                                         |
| Waveform Colors    | On mount + theme change, new WaveSurfer instance with explicit `waveColor` & `progressColor` (no CSS vars that break canvas gradient parsing) |
| Waveform Memory    | `unAll()` + `destroy()` + abort rejection swallow to prevent memory leaks                                                                     |
| and more...        | More features like drag-and-drop reordering, batch cover updates, and adaptive waveforms enhance the user experience.                         |

## üñ• UI / UX Highlights

MetaWave's UI is designed to be **fast, responsive, and intuitive**, with a focus on user experience. Here are some key highlights:

- **Animated Landing Hero**: Gradient backgrounds, typing / rotating text (planned), CTA emphasis.
- **Hero Album Section**: Contrast-preserving overlay with dynamic gradient fallback if no cover.
- **Card Micro‚ÄëInteractions**: Hover borders, shadow elevation, icon actions fade-in (opacity group revealing).
- **Input Styling**: Soft focus shadows + accessible ring for clarity.
- **Adaptive Waveforms**: Theme toggle triggers waveform recolor; fallback placeholder while loading.
- **Grid Strategy**: Strict max of 4 columns large; preserves card width legibility.
- **Progress-less Upload**: Lean immediate preview with object URL pre-insert for covers & avatars.
- **Skeleton Consistency**: Uniform radii + brand tinted neutral backgrounds for perceived speed.
- **Accessible Labels**: Every dialog field labeled (name, handle, dates, etc.).

MetaWave aims to provide a polished, cohesive experience that feels both modern and familiar, with a focus on usability and accessibility.

## üóÑ Data Model

MetaWave's data model is designed to be simple yet effective, focusing on user profiles, tracks, albums, and their relationships. The current version includes the following tables:

### Tables

| Table          | Description                                                           |

| `tracks`       | Track metadata (title, artist, release date, file URL, cover art URL) |
| `albums`       | Album metadata (title, cover art URL, public flag)                    |
| `album_tracks` | Join table linking tracks to albums with position for drag reordering |
| `track_tags`   | Future tagging system for tracks (mood, genre)                        |
| `tags`         | Tag definitions (name, color)                                         |

### Schema

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/schema.png" alt="MetaWave Database Schema" width="100%" style="border-radius:14px;" />
</p>

For more details on the schema, refer to the [`database` directory](database), where you can find the SQL migration files and schema definitions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with MetaWave, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/metawave.git
cd metawave

# Install
npm install

# Copy env
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Fill with: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# Dev
npm run dev
# http://localhost:3000
```

If using Supabase locally:

```bash
supabase start
# Add SQL schema (profiles, tracks, albums, album_tracks)
```

## üîê Environment Variables

MetaWave requires several environment variables to function correctly. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and populate it with the following variables:

| Variable                        | Required          | Description                    |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`      | ‚úÖ                | Supabase project URL           |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | ‚úÖ                | Public client key              |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`     | ‚ùå (server tasks) | Reserved future server scripts |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`          | ‚ùå                | Branding override              |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG_WAVE`        | ‚ùå                | Log waveform lifecycle (dev)   |

> [!WARNING]
> Never expose the service role key client-side.

## üß™ Development Scripts

MetaWave includes several npm scripts to streamline development and deployment:

| Script   | Purpose                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `dev`    | Start Next.js dev server      |
| `build`  | Production build              |
| `start`  | Run production build          |
| `lint`   | ESLint check (only in root)   |
| `format` | Prettier write (only in root) |
| `test`   | Run Jest tests                |

Feel free to add more scripts as needed, such as for database migrations or custom build steps.

## üñº Batch Artwork Updating

We've implemented a **Batch Cover Dialog** to streamline the process of updating cover art for multiple tracks at once. This feature is designed to enhance user experience by allowing quick updates without needing to edit each track individually.

1. Select tracks (checkbox overlay on library grid)
2. Open **Batch Cover Dialog**
3. Upload single image ‚Üí stored once per track path (ensures unique paths, optional dedupe later)
4. Update each track row `cover_art_url` sequentially (could be parallel batched in future)
5. Success toast + local reload

Future enhancements:

- Parallel `Promise.allSettled`
- MD5 hashing to avoid duplicate uploads

## ‚ôø Accessibility & Theming

MetaWave is built with accessibility and theming in mind, ensuring a consistent and inclusive user experience across different devices and preferences. Here are some key aspects:

| Aspect         | Implementation                                                                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Focus states   | Tailwind focus ring + outline none override                                              |
| Labels         | All modal fields labeled with `<Label>` or `sr-only`                                     |
| Color contrast | Album hero gradient overlay ensures readable text even with bright covers                |
| Theme toggle   | Dropdown (light / dark / system) persisting to `localStorage` with system watch fallback |
| Icons          | Semantically adjacent (edit pencil, trash for destructive, calendar for date)            |

| Narrow select queries                 | e.g. `select id,name,handle,avatar_url` for user search instead of `*`               |
| Controlled state resets               | Clearing selection set after album reload prevents stale UI                          |
| Waveform caching                      | Reuse existing waveforms on re-render to avoid re-fetching                           |
| Waveform memory management            | `unAll()` + `destroy()` to prevent memory leaks                                      |
| Client-side caching                   | Use `useSWR` for profiles, albums, and tracks to minimize fetches                    |
| Image optimization                    | Use Next.js `<Image>` component for automatic resizing and lazy loading              |
| Server-side rendering (SSR)           | Initial page load performance with pre-rendered HTML                                 |
| Client-side caching                   | Use `useSWR` for profiles, albums, and tracks to minimize fetches                    |
| Indexing & pagination                 | Use database indexing and pagination for large datasets to improve query performance |

## üîí Security & Validation

MetaWave takes security and data integrity seriously, implementing several layers of validation and access control:

| Layer             | Approach                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Input             | Zod schemas (profiles, albums, tracks)                                         |
| Storage paths     | Namespaced by user (`{user_id}/avatars`, `{owner_id}/covers/`)                 |
| Public vs Private | `is_public` flags on tracks & albums gating future list endpoints              |
| Client            | Never stores service keys or privileged tokens                                 |
| Ref Safety        | Optional chaining & fallback placeholders to mitigate runtime undefined errors |
| File Type         | `accept="image/*"` plus (future) server MIME enforcement                       |
| File Size         | Supabase storage limits (10MB max) enforced on upload                          |
| Auth              | Supabase Auth for user management, profile creation, and secure access control |
| Rate Limiting     | Future implementation to prevent abuse (e.g., too many uploads)                |
| Data Integrity    | Use of UUIDs for unique identifiers, ensuring no collisions in storage paths   |
| Error Handling    | Sonner toasts for user feedback on success/failure, with clear error messages  |

## üó∫ AWS Deployment

We also provide an optional **AWS deployment** setup for those who prefer a more robust infrastructure. This includes:

- **Ansible** for provisioning and configuration management.
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code, allowing you to define your AWS resources declaratively.

- Deploying the application code to the server.
- Managing server configurations and updates.
- Running database migrations and other setup tasks.
- Automating routine maintenance tasks.
- Configuring security groups, firewalls, and other network settings.
- Setting up monitoring and logging services.
- Managing SSL certificates for secure HTTPS connections.
- and more...

Terraform is used for:

- Defining and provisioning AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances, RDS databases, S3 buckets).
- Managing infrastructure as code, allowing for version control and reproducibility.
- Creating reusable modules for common infrastructure patterns.
- Managing dependencies between resources, ensuring they are created in the correct order.
- Handling resource updates and rollbacks in a controlled manner.
- Integrating with other tools and services in the AWS ecosystem.
- Managing state files to track the current state of the infrastructure.

With Ansible and Terraform, you can easily deploy MetaWave to AWS with a few commands, ensuring a consistent and reliable deployment process.

## üê¨ Docker & Containerization

MetaWave can be easily containerized using Docker, allowing for consistent development and production environments. The Docker setup includes:

- A `Dockerfile` for building the application image.
- A `docker-compose.yml` file for orchestrating the application, database, and any other services.
- Environment variables for configuration, similar to the `.env.local` file used in development.
- Volume mounts for persistent storage of uploaded files and database data.
- Health checks to ensure the application is running correctly.

To run MetaWave in a Docker container, follow these steps:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t metawave .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env.local metawave
# Access the application at http://localhost:3000
```

To run MetaWave with Docker Compose, use the provided `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
# Start the application with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
# Access the application at http://localhost:3000
```

Feel free to customize the Docker setup to fit your deployment needs, such as adding additional services or modifying environment variables.
